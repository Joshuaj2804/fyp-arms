A project made by me and my mate Imran (Loco) for our final year project

WHAT DOES IT DO?
- It's a system to manage and view inventory and maintenance records. It uses a QR code system that handles the QR codes for each new equipment in each lab and generates one for each. These QR Codes can be scanned to bring the user to the page of the equipment

WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T
- Everything works, however since the app is hosted on Heroku, the postdev database hasn't been setup asof version 1.0, hence posting new equipments or labs will not work.
However, when run in the localhost with a Python dev server, works flawlessly.

Version:
12/10/2019 -- v1.0: Initial Release
